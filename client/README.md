Introduction: This is a project that highlights a MERN stack using React, JavaScript, Nodejs, Express and MongoDB.

The user would have a profile, would be able to choose from various workouts they wanted, log, delete, and update their workouts. 



Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express. Imported helmet, morgan, cors.
